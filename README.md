Introducing Project Aurora
Introducing Project Aurora, the open source solution for automating your Git workflow on cloud virtual machines.

Our goal with Project Aurora is to help developers by providing a tool that streamlines the process of updating and running commands on your Git repositories in a cloud environment. With Project Aurora, you can easily set it up on a virtual machine in the cloud and let it automatically update your servers or run build scripts every time you make a commit to your repository.

We believe that automation should be accessible to everyone, and with Project Aurora, you can easily set it up on a cloud virtual machine and let it take care of the updates and scripts while you focus on development. Join us in making the development process more efficient with Project Aurora.
